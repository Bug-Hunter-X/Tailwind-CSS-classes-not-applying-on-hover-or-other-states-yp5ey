# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes fail to apply, especially on hover or other dynamic states.

## Description

The problem arises when Tailwind's directives, such as `hover`, are not correctly interpreted by the browser. This can stem from various issues, including incorrect class syntax, missing configuration, or conflicts with other CSS frameworks or styles.

## Solution

Check the following potential causes and solutions:

1. **Correct Syntax**: Ensure all Tailwind classes are correctly written according to the Tailwind CSS documentation (e.g., `bg-red-500`, `hover:bg-blue-700`)
2. **Purge CSS**: If you use PurgeCSS, ensure that your classes are correctly included in the configuration.
3. **CSS Specificity**: Verify there are no more specific CSS rules overriding Tailwind's classes.
4. **Conflicting Frameworks**: Check for conflicts with other CSS frameworks or stylesheets.
5. **Import Order**: Make sure you import Tailwind CSS correctly in your CSS or JavaScript file (usually in the head of your HTML). Ensure other conflicting CSS is placed after your Tailwind import to avoid overriding styles.
6. **Build Process**: If you use a build process (like Vite or Webpack), ensure it's correctly processing Tailwind CSS.
7. **Browser Extensions**: Some browser extensions may interfere. Try temporarily disabling them to test.
8. **Typographical Errors**: Always double check for any typos in class names.
9. **Parent Element:** Ensure that the parent element doesn't have conflicting styles that prevent child elements from inheriting the Tailwind classes.
10. **Just-in-Time (JIT) Mode**: Ensure JIT mode is correctly configured for the project.

By addressing these points, you can generally resolve the issue of Tailwind CSS classes not applying properly.
